ndr (0.5) ndr-xenial; urgency=medium

  * Add python3-pkg-resources to Depends list as python3:Depends didn't
    catch this requirement. Required for command line tools to actually
    work due to the way setuptools works (which makes me rethink how
    part of this should all come together ...)

ndr (0.3) ndr-xenial; urgency=medium

  * Hacky, but break out the config into its own module, and fix the downstream
    code to handle that so we can possibly build an image in a non-braindead way

ndr (0.2) ndr-xenial; urgency=medium
